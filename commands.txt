If you are using Docker Machine on Mac or Windows, your Docker daemon only has limited access to your OS X/ Windows filesystem.
Docker Machine tries to auto-share your /Users (OS X) or c:\Users (Windows) directory - and so you can only mount files or directories from there.
All other paths, if mounted, come from your virtual machine’s filesystem.
